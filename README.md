It consists of a technological solution where the programmers of a company or any private person, through a GitHub repository, can open a container automatically to be able to test your pages website as quickly as possible.

For this reason we have made our own PHP that is interconnected with a Docker farm, thus creating ready-made containers using the requests made from PHP.
